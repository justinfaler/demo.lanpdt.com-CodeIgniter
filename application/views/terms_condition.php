					</div>
					<div class="vwtc_text float-left col-lg-12 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12 text-left">
						<h4>GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
						<p>The arbitrability of any Disputes (as defined below) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state laws applicable to arbitrations. Regarding the substantive law of any Disputes, to the maximum extent authorized by law, the laws of the State of Texas govern the non-arbitration related interpretation of this Agreement and the substantive law of any Dispute, regardless of conflict of laws principles.</p>
						<p>Arbitration. Any Dispute shall be FINALLY and EXCLUSIVELY resolved by binding individual arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1-16).</p>
						<p>ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIM IS MANDATORY AND BINDING. NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE AAA CODE OF PROCEDURE.</p>
						<p>All determinations as to the scope, interpretation, enforceability and validity of this Agreement shall be made final exclusively by the arbitrator, which award shall be binding and final. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive: i) the termination of the Agreement; or ii) the bankruptcy of any party. If any portion of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall remain in force.</p>
						<p>NO CLASS ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR JOINDER OR CONSOLIDATION OF ANY CLAIM WITH A CLAIM OF ANOTHER PERSON OR CLASS OF CLAIMANTS SHALL BE ALLOWABLE.</p>
						<p>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO 335 SOUTHFIELD ROAD, SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA 71105, ATTN: LEGAL OPT-OUT AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION.</p>
						<p>Any arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less, its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will also apply. On disputes involving $75,000 or less, we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Harris County, Texas, US. We agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. Nothing herein prohibits us from asking the arbitrator to award us all costs of the arbitration including any Administrative Fees paid on your behalf.</p>
						<p>If the Dispute is not arbitrated by the choice of the parties or a court does not compel arbitration if either party elects to arbitrate for whatever reason, the Dispute will be decided by a court without any right by either party to a trial by jury. Any such court proceeding, including any efforts to compel arbitration or initially filed lawsuits that arises out of or relates to this Agreement or use of the Sites shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Shreveport, Louisiana, Caddo Parish.</p>
						<p>Dispute is defined as “Any dispute, claim or controversy between you and I Have a Question, Inc., its members, officers, directors, agents, parent companies and affiliated companies that arises out of or relates to this Agreement or use of the Site or Service, or otherwise regarding any aspect of your relationship with I Have a Question, Inc that has accrued or may thereafter accrue, whether based in contract, statute (including, but not limited to, any consumer protection statutes, regulation or ordinance), tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.</p>
